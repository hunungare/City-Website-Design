<p><b><font size="30" face="verdana" color="yellow">Mahalaxmi Temple </font></b> <style "color: white "> It is said that Man created God in his own image. How true! Man has attributed all the features of a human body to the Gods and Goddesses. He has also gone further to attribute several other characteristics to the divinities that are not found in human beings. It is fascinating to learn how Man created idols and statues of Gods and Goddesses. It is a process that started from a belief in Shakti (infinite energy) and culminated in the idol worship that conferred various forms to that infinite energy.</style>
<p style="color: white "><br>
In early days, this Shakti was witnessed in the form of five basic elements of Prithvi (earth), Aap (water), Tej (light), Vayu (wind), Akash (space). When Man pondered over his birth and the person responsible for it, he realized that mother is at the root of the genesis, and it is she who embodies the Shakti . He aspired to give a finite structure to the infinite energy. In the process he first named that finite structure as Matruka (representation of energy in the form of a divine mother). </p>
<br><p style="color: white"> As years passed Shakti that was represented by Paravati3 and Durga4 was also manifested in three different forms namely Mahalakshmi, Mahakali and Mahasaraswati. “The framing narrative of Devi Mahatmya Presents a dispossessed king, a merchant betrayed by his family, and a sage whose teachings lead them both beyond existential suffering. The sage instructs by recounting three different epic battles between the Devi (Goddess) and various demonic adversaries the three tales being governed by, respectively, Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati. Goddess Mahalakshmi is the presiding Goddess of the middle episode. Here she is depicted as Devi in her universal form as Shakti. The world was under attack by Mahishasura the most evil demon in the world, who took many different forms, including that of a buffalo. The male Gods, fearing total annihilation endowed Durga with their powers. The Goddess is described as eighteen- armed bearing string of beads, battle axe, maze, arrow, thunderbolt, lotus, bow, water-pot, cudgel, lance, sword, shield, conch, bell, wine-cup, trident, noose and the discus sudarsana. She has a complexion of coral and is seated on a lotus. She is known as Ashta Dasa Bhuja Mahalakshmi. Riding a lion into battle, she slew the buffalo by cutting off its head and then she destroyed the spirit of the demon as it emerged from the buffalo’s severed neck. It is through this act that order was established in the world”. Eventually the abovementioned description of Goddess Mahalakshmi was manifested in the form of idols. The evolution was gradual. The two dimensional concept of Lajjagauri developed in to a three dimensional form when art of idol making was initiated. Thus the statues of Goddesses in various avataras 8 of Durga were created. </p><br>

<p><b> <font size="30" face= "verdana" color="yellow">New Palace</font> </b><style "color: white"> Kolhapur is a palace situated in Kolhapur, in the Indian state of Maharastra. It was constructed between 1877–1884. Being an excellent specimen of architecture built in black polished stone, it has been an attraction for tourists. It has extensive premises with a garden, fountain and wrestling ground. The whole building is eight-angled and has a tower in the middle. The clock on it was fixed in 1877. At separate distances there are small towers. On every glass are painted the events in Shivaji's life. There is a zoo and a ground lake. Even today, it is the residence of Chhatrapati Shahu, the direct descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of Maratha Empire.</style><br>
</p><p style="color: white">
Mant's masterpiece at Kolhapur, however, is the New Palace, 1.5 km further north on Bhausingji Road. Completed in the same year as the Hospital, this complex presents a novel blend of disparate features in contrasting basalt and sandstone. The principal south fecade presents a double-storeyed range,with Neo-Mughal lobed arches beneath and temple-like columns and brackets above.This scheme is interrupted by trefoil arches capped with curving cornices and small domes. The same elements cap the octagonal corner towers.
</p><br>
<p style="color: white">
The ground floor of the New Palace accommodates the Shahaji Chhatrapati Museum, given over to memorabilia of the Kolhapur rulers. Several tourists from across the country visit the New Palace each year. This museum exhibits royal ways of existence.
</p>
<br><p style="color: white">
It is dedicated to a fine collection of possessions of Chhatrapatis of Kolhapur like costumes, weapons, games, jewellery, embroidery and paraphernalia such as silver elephant saddles. A letter from the British Viceroy and Governor General of India is the other memorabilia. There is also one of Aurangzeb's swords at the Shahaji Chhatrapati Museum. One section has stuffed Tigers, Tiger heads, Wild Dog, Sloth Bear, staring Wild Buffalo, Lion, Black Panther, Wild Boar, Black Buck, a number of other Deer varieties, and a Himalayan Black Bear.
</p>
<br><p style="color: white"0>
The Darbar Hall occupies a double-height space in middle of the Palace. The side walls display lobed arches filled with stained glass illustrating scenes from the life of Shivaji; carved columns with temple-like brackets support the cast iron balcony above. A raised throne is placed at one end of the Hall. Photos include one of the Maharajah with his hundredth dead tiger, elephant hunts and a series detailing how to train a cheetah.</p>
